   abstract                      = {Background Artificial Intelligence (AI) and its applications in health care are on the agenda of policymakers around the world, but a major challenge remains, namely, to set policies that will ensure wide acceptance and capture the value of AI while mitigating associated risks. Objective This study aims to provide an overview of how OECD countries strategize about how to integrate AI into health care and to determine their actual level of AI maturity. Methods A scan of government-based AI strategies and initiatives adopted in 10 proactive OECD countries was conducted. Available documentation was analyzed, using the Broadband Commission for Sustainable Development's roadmap to AI maturity as a conceptual framework. Results The findings reveal that most selected OECD countries are at the Emerging stage (Level 2) of AI in health maturity. Despite considerable funding and a variety of approaches to the development of an AI in health supporting ecosystem, only the United Kingdom and United States have reached the highest level of maturity, an integrated and collaborative AI in health ecosystem (Level 3). Conclusion Despite policymakers looking for opportunities to expedite efforts related to AI, there is no one-size-fits-all approach to ensure the sustainable development and safe use of AI in health. The principles of equifinality and mindfulness must thus guide policymaking in the development of AI in health care.},

Beginning with the assertion that concepts are not the same as constructs, we build the argument that concepts, which are observable sets of ideas, should take priority over constructs which are unobservable fictions and hypothetical entities. Using natural language processing (NLP) based principles and techniques, we extract a sample of the most important concepts in the IS field from a corpus of 245 highly cited IS review articles and 1,293 citing articles from the Senior Scholars’ Basket of Journals to illustrate the extent to which the field agrees on their usage, their clarity and distinctiveness and how the field can move forward in enhancing its conceptual formation.},

   abstract                      = {We present a probability-based metric for semantic consistency using a set of uncertain rules. As opposed to existing metrics for semantic consistency, our metric allows to consider rules that are expected to be fulfilled with specific probabilities. The resulting metric values represent the probability that the assessed dataset is free of internal contradictions with regard to the uncertain rules and thus have a clear interpretation. The theoretical basis for determining the metric values are statistical tests and the concept of the p-value, allowing the interpretation of the metric value as a probability. We demonstrate the practical applicability and effectiveness of the metric in a real-world setting by analyzing a customer dataset of an insurance company. Here, the metric was applied to identify semantic consistency problems in the data and to support decision-making, for instance, when offering individual products to customers.},

   abstract                      = {Background Centre-based cardiac rehabilitation (CBCR) is underused due to low referral rates, accessibility barriers, and socioeconomic constraints. mHealth technologies have the potential to address some of these challenges through remote delivery of home-based cardiac rehabilitation (HBCR). This study aims to assess the effects of mHealth HBCR interventions compared with usual care and CBCR in patients with heart disease. Methods We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials of mHealth HBCR interventions. Four electronic databases (MEDLINE, CENTRAL, CINAHL, and Embase) were searched from inception to March 31, 2023, with no restrictions on language or publication type. Eligible studies were randomised controlled trials of adult patients (age ≥18 years) with heart disease, comparing mHealth interventions with usual care or CBCR. The primary outcome of interest was aerobic exercise capacity, assessed with VO2 peak or 6-min walk test (6MWT). Quality of evidence was assessed using the GRADE system. This review was registered with PROSPERO, CRD42024544087. Findings Our search yielded 9164 references, of which 135 were retained for full-text review. 13 randomised controlled trials met eligibility criteria and were included in the systematic review, involving 1508 adults with myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, or heart failure, or who had undergone revascularisation. Intervention duration ranged from 6 weeks to 24 weeks. Random-effects meta-analysis showed that, compared with usual care, mHealth HBCR significantly improved 6MWT (mean difference 24·74, 95% CI 9·88–39·60; 532 patients) and VO2 peak (1·77, 1·19–2·35; 359 patients). No significant differences were found between mHealth HBCR and CBCR. Quality of evidence ranged from low to very low across outcomes due to risk of bias and imprecision (small sample size). Interpretation mHealth HBCR could improve access and health outcomes in patients who are unable to attend CBCR. Further research is needed to build a robust evidence base on the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of mHealth HBCR, particularly in comparison with CBCR, to inform clinical practice and policy.},

   abstract                      = {Although off‐the‐shelf enterprise systems (ES) have been widely adopted in organisations, the extant literature repeatedly documents ES failures caused by misfits between organisational processes and the ES. Although some misfits can be identified early in the ES lifecycle, others emerge in the onward and upward phase (i.e., after the implementation) and, hence, must be resolved reactively. Prior research on misfits and resolution strategies has primarily focused on the implementation phase, often assuming that close‐to‐perfect information on the misfit's nature and characteristics is available. However, no study has examined how to effectively complete a shared diagnosis and resolution of misfits when diverging individual user perceptions are taken as the starting point. Such situations may be particularly pronounced in pluralistic organisations, where a variety of interdependent processes and potentially competing perceptions of processes are prevalent. The main objective of this study is to address this gap. To this end, we propose a pragmatic method for the diagnosis and resolution of misfits between organisational processes and enterprise systems, which builds on an actionable conceptualization of misfits. This method builds on theoretical concepts of affordances, affordance actualization, user participation, and change agentry. To demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method, we conducted an action research study in a university hospital. Our analysis focused on a specific misfit involving the hospital's ES‐supported clinical processes. The findings suggest that the method effectively diagnoses and resolves misfits and optimises the resources required for their resolution through efficient management of user participation. We conclude with a discussion of the theoretical and practical contributions of our work.},

Teleconsultation is considered an opportunity to address these challenges while maintaining quality of care. In this paper, we develop and empirically test an extended Expectation Confirmation Model via an online survey of Canadian users. Our findings reveal that the main determinants of continuance intention are user satisfaction, perceived usefulness, service quality, confirmation of expectations, and perceived ease of use. As user satisfaction, the main predictor, largely depends on initial expectations confirmation, managers should provide their employees with proper information about the possibilities, limitations and potential benefits of teleconsultation platforms and services. This study underscores the importance of taking context into account at the theorizing stage.},

   abstract                      = {Background The COVID-19 crisis has drastically changed care delivery with teleconsultation platforms experiencing substantial spikes in demand, helping patients and care providers avoid infections and maintain health care services. Beyond the current pandemic, teleconsultation is considered a significant opportunity to address persistent health system challenges, including accessibility, continuity, and cost of care, while ensuring quality. Objective This study aims at identifying the determinants of patients’ intention to continue using a teleconsultation platform. It extends prior research on information technology use continuance intention and teleconsultation services. Methods Data was collected in November 2018 and May 2019 with Canadian patients who had access to a teleconsultation platform. Measures included patients’ intention to continue their use; teleconsultation usefulness; teleconsultation quality; patients’ trust toward the digital platform, its provider. and health care professionals; and confirmation of patients’ expectations toward teleconsultation. We used structural equation modeling employing the partial least squares component-based technique to test our research model and hypotheses. Results We analyzed a sample of 178 participants who had used teleconsultation services. Our findings revealed that confirmation of expectations had the greatest influence on continuance intention (total effects=0.722; P<.001), followed by usefulness (total effects=0.587; P<.001) and quality (total effects=0.511; P<.001). Usefulness (β=.60; P<.001) and quality (β=.34; P=.01) had direct effects on the dependent variable. The confirmation of expectations had direct effects both on usefulness (β=.56; P<.001) and quality (β=.75; P<.001) in addition to having an indirect effect on usefulness (indirect effects=0.282; P<.001). Last, quality directly influenced usefulness (β=.34; P=.002) and trust (β=.88; P<.001). Trust does not play a role in the context under study. Conclusions Teleconsultation is central to care going forward, and it represents a significant lever for an improved, digital delivery of health care in the future. We believe that our findings will help drive long-term teleconsultation adoption and use, including in the aftermath of the current COVID-19 crisis, so that general care improvement and greater preparedness for exceptional situations can be achieved.},

To dissociate corresponding profiles, we adopted a configurational perspective and conducted a two-stage survey study of 184 (t_0) and 138 (t_1) medical students at a Canadian medical school. Our principal findings corroborate the existence of distinct clusters in respondents’ AI profiles. We refer to these profiles as the AI unfamiliar, the AI educated, and the AI positive, showing that each profile is associated with different intentions towards future AI use.

   abstract                      = {Theorising plays a foundational role in Information Systems (IS) research. While the field has made important advances through theory borrowing, via adaptation and instantiation, as well as through contextualisation of established frameworks and models, comparatively little attention has been devoted to the elaboration of existing theories through structured, logic-driven approaches. This commentary problematises that imbalance and advances the concept of deductive theory elaboration as a valuable, yet underutilised, form of theorising in behavioural IS research. We define deductive theory elaboration as a process that extends existing theories by introducing conceptual modifications to their constructs, relationships, or boundary conditions prior to empirical testing. We distinguish this approach from related forms of theorising and propose a four-step framework supported by a repertoire of elaboration patterns for both variance and process theories. We also offer practical reporting guidelines to promote transparency and rigour in elaboration-based contributions. Our aim is to encourage more systematic elaboration efforts to enhance the precision, generalisability, and cumulative potential of IS theories, an optimistic vision of how behavioural IS research can evolve to meet the conceptual challenges of a rapidly transforming digital landscape.},

Large-scale studies with average samples exceeding 144,000 observations have considered over 70 variables explaining contracting decisions. Our review aims to facilitate the convergence towards commonly agreed categories of variables and overarching models of contracting decisions in this context. To mitigate the risk of propagating deflated p-values associated with large sample studies, we propose a robust version of vote-counting techniques. The principal findings of our research suggest that only a few variables related to the client-worker relationship, the bid and individual worker characteristics have a practically significant effect on worker selection, and that auction success is primarily affected by project value and client experience. These findings lay the groundwork for future research that will lead to better explanations of contracting decisions.},

Although many papers cite RAs, it is rarely transparent to which degree citation impact represents perfunctory citations as opposed to a deeper engagement with a RA’s knowledge contributions. This distinction between perfunctory and ideational impact has largely been neglected in the literature arguably because of the manual effort required for qualitative analysis. Against this background, our study aims at developing automated classifiers of ideational impact of IS RAs. We propose a machine learning model based on natural language processing to evaluate the feasibility of automated analyses. The evaluation results provide evidence for an effective and scalable classification approach that presents a reliable and reproducible solution to the ideational impact classification problem. We discuss implications for improving the capabilities of understanding how IS scholars build on their field’s body of knowledge.},

   abstract                      = {Ideational impact refers to the uptake of a paper's ideas and concepts by subsequent research. It is defined in stark contrast to total citation impact, a measure predominantly used in research evaluation that assumes that all citations are equal. Understanding ideational impact is critical for evaluating research impact and understanding how scientific disciplines build a cumulative tradition. Research has only recently developed automated citation classification techniques to distinguish between different types of citations and generally does not emphasize the conceptual content of the citations and its ideational impact. To address this problem, we develop Deep Content-enriched Ideational Impact Classification (Deep-CENIC) as the first automated approach for ideational impact classification to support researchers' literature search practices. We evaluate Deep-CENIC on 1256 papers citing 24 information systems review articles from the IT business value domain. We show that Deep-CENIC significantly outperforms state-of-the-art benchmark models. We contribute to information systems research by operationalizing the concept of ideational impact, designing a recommender system for academic papers based on deep learning techniques, and empirically exploring the ideational impact in the IT business value domain.},

Unlike traditional methods, NCA identifies essential, non-compensable factors influencing adoption. Findings reveal that belief in AIHTs’ role in medicine is a persistent necessary condition, while the perceived importance of AIHTs in the curriculum emerges as critical post-COVID-19. Despite increased familiarity and experimentation with AIHTs, these alone are insufficient to drive adoption. These insights underscore the need for medical curricula to emphasize AI literacy, hands-on training, and interdisciplinary collaboration. By identifying key conditions for AI adoption, this study informs educators and policymakers on preparing medical students for a technology-driven healthcare landscape.},

   abstract                      = {Background Unhealthy behaviors, such as physical inactivity, sedentary lifestyle, and unhealthful eating, remain highly prevalent, posing formidable challenges in efforts to improve cardiovascular health. While traditional interventions to promote healthy lifestyles are both costly and effective, wearable trackers, especially Fitbit devices, can provide a low-cost alternative that may effectively help large numbers of individuals become more physically fit and thereby maintain a good health status. Objective The objectives of this meta-analysis are (1) to assess the effectiveness of interventions that incorporate a Fitbit device for healthy lifestyle outcomes (eg, steps, moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, and weight) and (2) to identify which additional intervention components or study characteristics are the most effective at improving healthy lifestyle outcomes. Methods A systematic review was conducted, searching the following databases from 2007 to 2019: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and CENTRAL (Cochrane). Studies were included if (1) they were randomized controlled trials, (2) the intervention involved the use of a Fitbit device, and (3) the reported outcomes were related to healthy lifestyles. The main outcome measures were related to physical activity, sedentary behavior, and weight. All the studies were assessed for risk of bias using Cochrane criteria. A random-effects meta-analysis was conducted to estimate the treatment effect of interventions that included a Fitbit device compared with a control group. We also conducted subgroup analysis and fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) to further disentangle the effects of intervention components. Results Our final sample comprised 41 articles reporting the results of 37 studies. For Fitbit-based interventions, we found a statistically significant increase in daily step count (mean difference [MD] 950.54, 95% CI 475.89-1425.18; P<.001) and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MD 6.16, 95% CI 2.80-9.51; P<.001), a significant decrease in weight (MD −1.48, 95% CI −2.81 to −0.14; P=.03), and a nonsignificant decrease in objectively assessed and self-reported sedentary behavior (MD −10.62, 95% CI −35.50 to 14.27; P=.40 and standardized MD −0.11, 95% CI −0.48 to 0.26; P=.56, respectively). In general, the included studies were at low risk for bias, except for performance bias. Subgroup analysis and fsQCA demonstrated that, in addition to the effects of the Fitbit devices, setting activity goals was the most important intervention component. Conclusions The use of Fitbit devices in interventions has the potential to promote healthy lifestyles in terms of physical activity and weight. Fitbit devices may be useful to health professionals for patient monitoring and support.

Methodologists have drawn attention to the question of how we can leverage the value of LRs to preserve and generate knowledge. The panelists who participated in the discussion of “Standalone Literature Reviews in IS Research: What Can Be Learnt from the Past and Other Fields?” at ICIS 2016 in Dublin acknowledged this significant issue and debated 1) what the IS field can learn from other fields and where IS-specific challenges occur, 2) how the IS field should move forward to foster the genre of LRs, and 3) the best practices to train doctoral IS students in publishing LRs. This paper reports the key takeaways of this panel discussion. We provide guidance for IS scholars on how to conduct LRs that contribute to the cumulative knowledge development in and across the IS field to best prepare the next generation of IS scholars.},

Yet, we observe a lack of theoretical underpinning of and epistemological insights into how literature reviews can contribute to knowledge creation and have actually contributed in the IS discipline. To address these theoretical and empirical research gaps, we suggest a novel epistemological model of literature reviews. This model allows us to align different contributions of literature reviews with their underlying knowledge conversions - thereby building a bridge between the previously largely unconnected fields of literature reviews and epistemology. We evaluate the appropriateness of the model by conducting an empirical analysis of 173 IS literature reviews which were published in 39 pertinent IS journals between 2000 and 2014. Based on this analysis, we derive an epistemological taxonomy of IS literature reviews, which complements previously suggested typologies.},

Yet, we observe insufficient insights into the activities with which LRs actually develop knowledge. To address this important gap, we 1) derive knowledge-building activities from the extant literature on LRs, 2) suggest a knowledge-based LR typology that complements existing typologies, and 3) apply the typology in an empirical study that explores how LRs with different goals and methodologies have contributed to knowledge development. In analyzing 240 LRs published in 40 renowned information systems (IS) journals between 2000 and 2014, we draw a detailed picture of knowledge development that one of the most important genres in the IS field has achieved. With this work, we help to unify extant LR conceptualizations by clarifying and illustrating how they apply different methodologies in a range of knowledge-building activities to achieve their goals with respect to theory.},

   abstract                      = {CAPTCHAs are challenge-response tests that aim at preventing unwanted machines, including bots, from accessing web services while providing easy access for humans. Recent advances in artificial-intelligence based attacks show that the level of security provided by many state-of-the-art text-based CAPTCHAs is declining. At the same time, techniques for distorting and obscuring the text, which are used to maintain the level of security, make text-based CAPTCHAs difficult to solve for humans, and thereby further degrade usability. The need for developing alternative types of CAPTCHAs that improve both the current security and the usability levels has been emphasized widely. With this study, we contribute to research through (1) the development of two new face recognition CAPTCHAs (Farett-Gender and Farett-Gender&Age), (2) the security analysis of both procedures, and (3) the provision of empirical evidence that one of the suggested CAPTCHAs (Farett-Gender) is similar to Google's reCAPTCHA and better than KCAPTCHA concerning effectiveness (error rates), superior to both regarding learnability and satisfaction but not efficiency.},

IS design theories (ISDTs) have been recognized as a particularly important building block for the accumulation of design- oriented knowledge. Yet, there are limited insights into how follow-up research builds on IS design theories in terms of testing and extending. To address these issues, we present results from the first empirical analysis of how ISDTs have been tested and extended within and beyond IS journals. Our qualitative analysis of papers citing ISDTs uncovers an alarming paucity of follow-up research that builds on these ISDTs. Specifically, the overall number of papers testing and extending any of the selected ISDTs ranges in the single digits. To propose an actionable path forward, we formulate four specific guidelines on how the IS(-DSR) community can facilitate the cumulative extension of the IS knowledge base.},

   abstract                      = {Since its inception, the Information Systems discipline has been striving to develop impactful papers that contribute to cumulative knowledge development. Yet, there is a surprising lack of insights on how scientific impact can be accomplished and to which extent this impact represents a substantial engagement with, and extension of the knowledge contributions of the original papers. Especially for review articles and design science research, there are both competing conceptions of what makes these papers impactful and a lack of empirical evidence that would inform this debate. Furthermore, there is a latent skepticism as to whether this sometimes staggering impact of review articles actually represents knowledge development. In a similar way, it is unclear how and to which extent design science research has stimulated meaningful, cumulative knowledge development in information systems. The goal of this thesis is therefore to (1) explain and to (2) distinguish the scientific impact of review articles and design science research. Specifically, the first goal considers overall scientific impact as the dependent variable whose association with antecedent factors is analyzed by regression methodologies. The second goal zooms in on the concept of scientific impact and considers it as a relation between citing and cited papers that is explored through methodologies of manual content analysis and machine- learning classification.<br>With Paper 1, I develop the foundation of knowledge development through review articles by crystallizing their contributions and aligning them with their underlying knowledge conver- sion processes in an overarching framework. This framework is based on the abstraction and codification of knowledge and thereby integrates two essential dimensions of knowledge devel- opment. Overall, the foundation developed in the first paper informs the underlying conception of knowledge development of both review articles and citing papers.<br>Addressing the first goal, Papers 2 and 3 develop and test scientometric impact models ex- plaining the scientific impact of review articles and design science research, respectively. Beyond common control variables related to the journal and author level, they offer distinct insights for each type of paper. For review articles, I identify strong effects related to methodological transparency and the development of a research agenda, which vary depending on the type of review. For design science research, I show that theorization and novelty drive scientific impact.<br>Concerning the second goal, Papers 4 and 5 distinguish different types of scientific impact of review articles and design science research, respectively. To analyze the different types of impact that review articles have on their overwhelming number of citing papers, I develop machine learning classifiers. Specifically, I distinguish ideational impact, which corresponds to a substantial engagement with and development of the knowledge contributions of the review article, from perfunctory impact, which corresponds to more trivial connections to the review article. In a similar, though not automated way, I analyze the types of impact of information systems design theories, a particular type of design science research. These analyses primarily focus on whether follow-up research tests and extends these theories. Based on our content analysis, I identify an alarming paucity of follow-up research in this area and develop specific guidelines for the design science community to address this challenge.<br>The thesis concludes with an overview of the research contributions, implications for research practice, future research opportunities, and final remarks.},

   abstract                      = {BibDedupe is a Python library developed for bibliographic record deduplication in meta-analysis and research synthesis. It is constructed with a focus on four requirements: (1) Zero false positives: The primary objective is to prevent incorrectly merging distinct entries. This focus on zero false positives is crucial to ensure trustworthiness and prevent biased conclusions in the analysis. (2) Reproducibility: BibDedupe implements fixed rules to produce consistent results, in line with the scientific standard of reproducibility. (3) Efficiency: The library is also tuned for low false-negative rates and rapid processing, to ensure scalability of the duplicate identification process. (4) Continuous evaluation and improvement: It is continuously evaluated on over 160,000 records from 10 datasets to ensure its effectiveness, especially in follow-up refinements. Unlike general-purpose deduplication tools, BibDedupe is specifically designed for the unique requirements of bibliographic data in meta-analysis and research synthesis. In this context, BibDedupe aims to provide a Python library that improves the effectiveness and efficiency of duplicate identification, potentially benefitting review papers across scientific disciplines.},

   abstract                      = {Understanding a new literature corpus can be a grueling experience for junior scholars. Nevertheless, corresponding guidelines have not been updated for decades. We contend that the traditional strategy of skimming all papers and reading selected papers afterwards needs to be revised. Therefore, we design a new strategy that guides the overall exploratory process by prioritizing influential papers for initial reading, followed by skimming the remaining papers. Consistent with schemata theory, starting with indepth reading allows readers to acquire more substantial prior content schemata, which are representative for the literature corpus and useful in the following skimming process. To this end, we develop a prototype that identifies the influential papers from a set of PDFs, which is illustrated in a case study in the IT business value domain. With the new strategy, we envision a more efficient process of exploring unknown literature corpora.},

In this context, literature reviews stand out because they operate on large and rapidly growing volumes of documents, that is, partially structured (meta)data, and pervade almost every type of paper published in information systems research or related social science disciplines. To familiarize researchers with some of the recent trends in this area, we outline how AI can expedite individual steps of the literature review process. Considering that the use of AI in this context is in an early stage of development, we propose a comprehensive research agenda for AI-based literature reviews (AILRs) in our field. With this agenda, we would like to encourage design science research and a broader constructive discourse on shaping the future of AILRs in research.},

Research on this emergent phenomenon has recently gained traction in terms of publication volume and research diversity. Focusing on the contributions of information systems research, we conducted a literature review to distinguish papers on DPKW from related types of digital platforms, to synthesize what we know about knowledge work on DPKW, and to guide future research. Based on a comprehensive literature search, we derived five boundary conditions, which constitute our definition of DPKW: digitality, value network paradigm, centralized governance, contractual work, and knowledge work. We further developed a conceptual process framework of the constituent processes of DPKW. With this framework, we elaborate on an established process model to distinguish the three macro­level processes of matching, contracting, and executing. We further examined micro­level processes suggested in extant research based on a process linking approach in order to understand how they synchronically instantiate each macro­level process. Emphasizing the significance of the micro­ and macro­level processes and the emergent stage of the literature on DPKW, we offer an agenda for future research and outline implications for practice.},

Although previous empirical research has shown that this impact has a large variance, it is largely unknown which specific factors influence the impact of literature reviews. Against this background, the purpose of our study is to shed light on the driving factors that make a difference in the scientific impact of literature reviews. Our analysis of an exhaustive set of 214 IS literature reviews reveals that factors on the author level (e.g., expertise, collaboration, and conceptual feedback) and on the article level (e.g., methodological rigor) are significant and robust predictors of scientific impact over and above journal level factors. These insights enhance our understanding of what distinguishes highly cited literature reviews. In so doing, our study informs future guidelines on literature reviews and provides insights for prospective authors.},

While ongoing debates address the relative importance of design science contributions in the information systems community, insights into the scientific impact of design science research (DSR) are missing and this lack of understanding arguably poses challenges to an informed discourse. To identify the most influential papers and those factors that explain their scientific impact, this paper presents an exploratory study of the scientific impact of DSR papers published in the AIS Senior Scholars' Basket of Journals. We uncover the current DSR landscape by taking stock of influential papers and theories and develop a model to explain the scientific impact of DSR papers. Our findings show that scientific impact is significantly explained by theorization and novelty. We discuss how the implications of our work can be projected on the overarching discourse on DSR.},

Therefore, after mapping impactful IS DSR papers, we develop a scientometric study to address the lack of insights into factors that affect the scientific impact of IS DSR papers in top IS journals. In this study, we focus on active, IS-specific DSR areas and consider papers published in the AIS Senior Scholars’ basket of journals between 2004 and 2014. Specifically, we develop a model that explores factors that affect IS DSR papers’ scientific impact. Our findings show that theorization and novelty significantly explain scientific impact.

   abstract                      = {Background Prospective physicians are expected to find artificial intelligence (AI) to be a key technology in their future practice. This transformative change has caught the attention of scientists, educators, and policy makers alike, with substantive efforts dedicated to the selection and delivery of AI topics and competencies in the medical curriculum. Less is known about the behavioral perspective or the necessary and sufficient preconditions for medical students’ intention to use AI in the first place. Objective Our study focused on medical students’ knowledge, experience, attitude, and beliefs related to AI and aimed to understand whether they are necessary conditions and form sufficient configurations of conditions associated with behavioral intentions to use AI in their future medical practice. Methods We administered a 2-staged questionnaire operationalizing the variables of interest (ie, knowledge, experience, attitude, and beliefs related to AI, as well as intention to use AI) and recorded 184 responses at t0 (February 2020, before the COVID-19 pandemic) and 138 responses at t1 (January 2021, during the COVID-19 pandemic). Following established guidelines, we applied necessary condition analysis and fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis to analyze the data. Results Findings from the fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis show that the intention to use AI is only observed when students have a strong belief in the role of AI (individually necessary condition); certain AI profiles, that is, combinations of knowledge and experience, attitudes and beliefs, and academic level and gender, are always associated with high intentions to use AI (equifinal and sufficient configurations); and profiles associated with nonhigh intentions cannot be inferred from profiles associated with high intentions (causal asymmetry). Conclusions Our work contributes to prior knowledge by showing that a strong belief in the role of AI in the future of medical professions is a necessary condition for behavioral intentions to use AI. Moreover, we suggest that the preparation of medical students should go beyond teaching AI competencies and that educators need to account for the different AI profiles associated with high or nonhigh intentions to adopt AI.},

   abstract                      = {Background The practice of evidence-based medicine (EBM) has become pivotal in enhancing medical care and patient outcomes. With the diffusion of innovation in healthcare organizations, EBM can be expected to depend on medical professionals’ competences with digital health (dHealth) and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies.  Objective We aim to investigate the effect of dHealth competences and perceptions of AI on the adoption of EBM among prospective physicians. By focusing on dHealth and AI technologies, the study seeks to inform the redesign of medical curricula to better prepare students for the demands of evidence-based medical practice.  Methods A cross-sectional survey was administered online to students at the University of Montreal’s medical school, which has approximately 1,400 enrolled students. The survey included questions on students’ dHealth competences, perceptions of AI, and their practice of EBM. Using structural equation modeling (SEM), we analyzed data from 177 respondents to test our research model.  Results Our analysis indicates that medical students possess foundational knowledge competences of dHealth technologies and perceive AI to play an important role in the future of medicine. Yet, their experiential competences with dHealth technologies are limited. Our findings reveal that experiential dHealth competences are significantly related to the practice of EBM (β = 0.42, p < 0.001), as well as students’ perceptions of the role of AI in the future of medicine (β = 0.39, p < 0.001), which, in turn, also affect EBM (β = 0.19, p < 0.05).  Conclusions The study underscores the necessity of enhancing students’ competences related to dHealth and considering their perceptions of the role of AI in the medical profession. In particular, the low levels of experiential dHealth competences highlight a promising starting point for training future physicians while simultaneously strengthening their practice of EBM. Accordingly, we suggest revising medical curricula to focus on providing students with practical experiences with dHealth and AI technologies.},

   abstract                      = {Git, as the leading version-control system, is frequently employed by software developers, digital product managers, and knowledge workers. Information systems (IS) students aspiring to fill software engineering, management, or research positions would therefore benefit from familiarity with Git. However, teaching Git effectively can be challenging, as students in IS and other disciplines report themselves overwhelmed by the plethora of Git’s detailed commands and options, including those involved in local setup and secure shell (SSH) connections. From our view, such technical considerations distract students, and even prevent them from developing a deeper understanding of the Git model and its underlying concepts. Ideally, teaching efforts should convey a solid understanding of the Git model and thereby enable students to ask the right questions and look up the relevant commands. With this teaching tip, we therefore challenge the common approach to organizing Git teaching materials. In particular, we draw on established pedagogical theory to propose a novel approach that employs a new, macro-level ordering of contents beginning with the concept of branches and then proceeding to committing and collaboration. We present several practical strategies that make this approach feasible. In addition, we recommend that teachers clearly separate conceptual from applied learning and present the more challenging transfer questions at the end of the course. Our hope is to stimulate reflection on the most effective ways to teach Git to future professionals.},

   abstract                      = {Nowadays, providing employees with failure-free access to various systems, applications and services is a crucial factor for organizations’ success as disturbances potentially inhibit smooth workflows and thereby harm productivity. However, it is a challenging task to assign access rights to employees’ accounts within a satisfying time frame. In addition, the management of multiple accounts and identities can be very onerous and time consuming for the responsible administrator and therefore expensive for the organization. In order to meet these challenges, firms decide to invest in introducing an Identity and Access Management System (IAMS) that supports the organization by using policies to assign permissions to accounts, groups, and roles. In practice, since various versions of IAMSs exist, it is a challenging task to decide upon introduction of an IAMS. The following study proposes a first attempt of a decision support model for practitioners which considers four alternatives: Introduction of an IAMS with Role-based Access Control (RBAC) or without and no introduction of IAMS again with or without RBAC. To underpin the practical applicability of the proposed model, we parametrize and operationalize it based on a real world use case using input from an expert interview.},

   abstract                      = {Today, organizations must deal with a plethora of IT security threats and to ensure smooth and uninterrupted business operations, firms are challenged to predict the volume of IT security vulnerabilities and allocate resources for fixing them. This challenge requires decision makers to assess which system or software packages are prone to vulnerabilities, how many post-release vulnerabilities can be expected to occur during a certain period of time, and what impact exploits might have. Substantial research has been dedicated to techniques that analyze source code and detect security vulnerabilities. However, only limited research has focused on forecasting security vulnerabilities that are detected and reported after the release of software. To address this shortcoming, we apply established methodologies which are capable of forecasting events exhibiting specific time series characteristics of security vulnerabilities, i.e., rareness of occurrence, volatility, non-stationarity, and seasonality. Based on a dataset taken from the National Vulnerability Database (NVD), we use the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) to measure the forecasting accuracy of single, double, and triple exponential smoothing methodologies, Croston’s methodology, ARIMA, and a neural network-based approach. We analyze the impact of the applied forecasting methodology on the prediction accuracy with regard to its robustness along the dimensions of the examined system and software package “operating systems”, “browsers” and “office solutions” and the applied metrics. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to analyze the effect of forecasting methodologies and to apply metrics that are suitable in this context. Our results show that the optimal forecasting methodology depends on the software or system package, as some methodologies perform poorly in the context of IT security vulnerabilities, that absolute metrics can cover the actual prediction error precisely, and that the prediction accuracy is robust within the two applied forecasting-error metrics.},
